Deployment Guide:

1. Change the .env for Deployment variables
2. Look for Database on Prisma if Production Environment Matches the same Database used
3. After configuring the Database run prisma migrations
3.1 npx prisma migrate dev --name "Deployment" - to migrate the latest changes on the Database
3.2 npx prisma migrate reset - this will reset the database and populate the the db using seeder file
3.3 npx prisma generate - to make sure prisma configured properly
4. change the module_alias route on the package.json to direct to dist folder for deployment: Currently directing to src which used on development
5. npm run build - to check error before deploying
6. npm run start - to make sure that this has no error
7. run git add .
7.1 git commit -m "deploying"
7.2 git push origin main
8. Add additional info if error was encountered deploying this service


Additional:
1. if Frontend url is changed also change the url from the env and also implicit declare it on the server.ts (CORS part: allowedOrigins)
